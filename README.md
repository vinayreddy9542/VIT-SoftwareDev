# First day
# Level_one

In the level one of the game as given consists of 6 balls and for each ball i have takes the random ball type using the random class and then displayed the probabilities of various available types of shots then the player is asked for the type of shot and then after input processing the probility of selected shot is been hit or not then then score is been updated.


# Level_two

In addition to the level one i have extended game to 3 overs.


# Level_three

i have used client server program (with the help of socket programming) to develop the multiplayer game  and have assumed a innigs will be for 1 over.
and the first player is given the first batting by default which can be changed by getting a new variable for toss.


Note : for this the ui can be develped using the JSP and SERVLETS or simply by SpringBoot.

# Second day (re-test)

# Level_one

I have made a array of type pawn(a separate object) and stored board in that then the input was taken from both the users and assigned them to the first(Player A) and last(Player B) rows as per their player numbers respectively.
then based on the count of players available assumed it be p1 and p2 for player A and Player B respectively i have made a play until both p1 and p2 are greater than 0.
then the winner is declared.

# Level_Two

I have made a array of type Playertype(a separate object which stores the type of the player( pawn,hero 1,hero 2)) and stored board in that then the input was taken from both the users and assigned them to the first(Player A) and last(Player B) rows as per their player numbers respectively.
then based on the count of players available assumed it be p1 and p2 for player A and Player B respectively i have made a play until both p1 and p2 are greater than 0.
then the winner is declared.

# Level_three

in addtion to the Level_two we need to add plyer type hero 3 and continue the same as procede in Level_two with an extra case w.r.t the hero 3 moves.

Note : In this code the complete test case validation is been done and the gae proceeds only when the users give the correct input.
